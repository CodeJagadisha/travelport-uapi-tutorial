## The goal of this tutorial

Travelport Universal API&trade; is the world's first global GDS API to aggregate content from multiple sources including GDS, low cost-carriers and high speed rail operators.

For developers, it means an end to managing and maintaining multiple APIs. You'll have less code to write and more time to spend on your other responsibilities.

This tutorial helps developers understanding how to use the uAPI step by step, from connecting to the uAPI to coding a cool Facebook travel application.

## Table of contents

The tutorial is broken into three sections, or "units", each of which has a separate objective; each unit is broken into three "lessons" that take you part of the way towards the goal of the unit.

### Unit 1

The first unit will teach you how to setup and configure the Travelport Universal Api&trade; (uAPI) and how to make some basic requests through that API.  With this section complete, you can ask Travelport for information about rail and air travel, such as schedules and availability, and of course get the prices associated with that travel.

Lesson 2: [Basic air travel requests](lesson_1-2.html)
	
Lesson 3: [Advanced travel shopping](lesson_1-3.html)
	

### Unit 2

The second unit is about finding accommodation in an area, using city and geocodes to refine search options, and completing a booking for a passenger. With this section complete, you can build a complete flight and hotel booking application.

Lesson 4: [Hotel search, searching by landmark](lesson_2-4.html)

Lesson 5: [Making an Air or Hotel booking](lesson_2-5.html)
	

### Unit 3

The final unit will help you build a working [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) application that uses the uAPI to determine things like, "How much would it cost for me to visit my friend Joe on his birthday next month?".

Lesson 6: [Travelport E-volve Facebook app](lesson_3-6.html)

Lesson 7: [Building a travel app for Facebook](lesson_3-7.html)
	
Lesson 8: [Universal API&trade; from inside a Facebook app](lesson_3-8.html)
	
Lesson 9: [Better mapping integration in Facebook](lesson_3-9.html)
