## Unit 3, Lesson 8

### Objective of Lesson 8

In this lesson, we'll document the how to send a basic PHP vehicle Search Request.

As we have already gone through simple Air and complex Hotel in the tutorial we focused on how to create a vehicle search using php.

##Coding

Again as we have already covered in previous lessons how the Air and Hotel work with Php there is not much difference in sending the request except the
endpoint and xml request message change. We have done the same just changed the curl_init to use the vehicleService and changed the xml request to vehicle search
request and we are done. Your vehicle search request is ready.

### The Future

To summarize what is coming up in the tutorial, We have vehicle details and booking request in line to add to the php vehicle tutorial.
